# Week 2 – EV Adoption Forecasting

**File:** `EV_Adoption_Forecasting.ipynb`

---

## 🎯 Objective

To forecast electric vehicle (EV) adoption using historical EV registration data with a machine learning model. This is a continuation of Week 1 where data was cleaned and prepared.

---

## 📁 Files Included
- `EV_Adoption_Forecasting.ipynb`: Notebook for feature engineering, model training, and forecasting
- `preprocessed_ev_data.csv`: Cleaned dataset after Week 1
- `forecasting_ev_model.pkl`: Trained machine learning model saved using Pickle

---

## 🛠 Methods Used
- Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing
- Train-Test Split
- Linear Regression Model
- Model Serialization using `pickle`
- Visualization of Forecasted Trends

---

## 🔍 Results
- Model trained and tested
- Forecast of EV demand visualized
- Model saved for future deployment
