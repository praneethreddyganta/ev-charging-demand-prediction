# Week 2 – EV Adoption Forecasting

**Notebook:** `EV_Adoption_Forecasting.ipynb`

---

## 🎯 Objective

To forecast electric vehicle (EV) adoption using historical registration data by building a machine learning model. This week builds upon Week 1 by transforming the cleaned data into meaningful predictions.

## 📁 Files Included

- `EV_Adoption_Forecasting.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with complete code and results
- `preprocessed_ev_data.csv` – Cleaned dataset used for modeling
- `forecasting_ev_model.pkl` – Trained model saved using `pickle`
- `README.md` – Project description and documentation

---

## 🛠 Methods Used
