# EV Charging Demand Prediction

**EV_Vehicle_Charging_Demand_Prediction**

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) registration data to understand EV adoption trends and charging demand. The cleaned dataset is used in Week 2 for forecasting future adoption rates.

---

## Problem Statement

Given a dataset containing regional EV registrations, the objective is to clean and analyze the data to prepare it for predictive modeling. This includes handling missing values, removing outliers, and basic visualizations.
