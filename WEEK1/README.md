# EV Charging Demand Prediction

**EV_Vehicle_Charging_Demand_Prediction**

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) registration data to understand EV adoption trends and charging demand. Cleaned data from this step is used for forecasting in Week 2.

---

## 🚧 Problem Statement

Given a dataset containing location-wise EV registrations, our goal is to analyze patterns, clean inconsistencies, and make the data ready for future prediction models.
